# Data Workflow Process

This document outlines the standard data workflow process from the "Raw" data folder to the "Final" data folder, including the "Processed" data folder. This process ensures that data is properly cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis.

## 1. Raw Data

- **Folder:** Raw
- **Purpose:** The "Raw" folder contains the original, untouched data as received from external sources or collected internally. This data serves as the source of truth.

## 2. Data Ingestion

- **Task:** Move data from the "Raw" folder to the "Staging" folder for initial data ingestion and preparation.
- **Folder:** Staging
- **Purpose:** The "Staging" folder is used to prepare data for further processing.

## 3. Data Cleaning and Transformation

- **Task:** Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values, outliers, and data type conversions.
- **Folder:** Staging
- **Purpose:** Prepare data in the "Staging" folder for analysis by ensuring it is accurate and consistent.

## 4. Data Exploration

- **Task:** Explore the data in the "Staging" folder to understand its characteristics and identify potential insights.
- **Folder:** Staging
- **Purpose:** Gain insights into the data, which will inform further data processing steps.

## 5. Intermediate Data Storage

- **Task:** Move cleaned and explored data from the "Staging" folder to the "Processed" folder.
- **Folder:** Processed
- **Purpose:** The "Processed" folder is used to store data that has undergone initial cleaning and exploration.

## 6. Additional Data Transformation

- **Task:** Perform additional data transformations, such as feature engineering or aggregations, on data in the "Processed" folder.
- **Folder:** Processed
- **Purpose:** Create datasets in the "Processed" folder that are tailored for specific analysis goals.

## 7. Data Quality Assurance

- **Task:** Ensure data quality by conducting thorough quality checks and validation.
- **Folder:** Processed
- **Purpose:** Verify that data in the "Processed" folder is accurate and reliable for analysis.

## 8. Intermediate Data Storage (Interim)

- **Task:** Move data from the "Processed" folder to the "Interim" folder as needed for specific analysis steps.
- **Folder:** Interim
- **Purpose:** The "Interim" folder is used to store intermediate datasets that are essential for specific analysis steps.

## 9. Final Data Storage

- **Task:** Move the final analysis-ready data from the "Interim" folder to the "Final" folder.
- **Folder:** Final
- **Purpose:** The "Final" folder contains cleaned and processed data that is ready for analysis, reporting, or sharing with stakeholders.

## 10. Documentation

- **Task:** Document all data processing steps, transformations, and any relevant metadata.
- **Folder:** docs
- **Purpose:** Maintain clear documentation to ensure reproducibility and transparency in the data analysis process.

This workflow provides a structured approach to preparing data for analysis, ensuring that data is accurate, cleaned, and transformed appropriately before it reaches its final state in the "Final" folder.
